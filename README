Holidays

This is an app for WebOS devices that shows what weekdays (and dates) swedish holidays occur a given year.
It's built using the enyo framework.

Requirements

Your device needs to have the enyo framework installed, so you either need a TouchPad, a Pre3, or have installed the "magic" maps update that installed enyo on older devices.

License

This is free software. If you like it, buy me a beer sometime.
